# ML-Neural-Netwrok-Model
 This project seeks to create a Neural Network Model which would help in predicting Fahrenheit values from Celsius.
This model is a neural network-based regression model implemented using TensorFlow. It predicts Fahrenheit temperatures based on Celsius temperatures. The model architecture consists of two hidden layers with 64 and 128 units respectively, and an output layer. It is trained for 500 epochs with a mean squared error loss function and Adam optimizer. The training and testing data are split using a train-test split of 80:20. The model's training progress is visualized using a graph showing the loss magnitude over epochs. The model's predictions are evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), R-squared (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).
